Local Server
The Local Server is a simple JavaScript application that utilizes Node.js to create a basic web server on your local machine. It allows you to serve web content and interact with it through HTTP requests.

Requirements
To run the Local Server, you need to have the following:

Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
Usage
Clone the repository or create a new JavaScript file and save the server code in it.

Open a command-line interface or terminal.

Navigate to the directory where the JavaScript file is located.

Run the following command to start the local server:

shell
Copy code
node server.js
The server will start running, and you will see a console message indicating the server's address and port.

Open your web browser and enter the following URL:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
This will access the server running on your local machine.

You should see a "Hello, World!" message displayed in your browser. This confirms that the server is working correctly.

You can modify the server code to serve different content or handle specific HTTP requests based on your requirements.

To stop the server, go back to the command-line interface or terminal where the server is running and press Ctrl + C.

Customization
You can customize the local server by modifying the JavaScript code. Here are some possible modifications you can make:

Change the hostname and port variables to set a different server address.
Modify the server response to serve different content or handle specific HTTP requests.
Add additional routes and functionality to the server based on your needs.
Remember to restart the server after making any changes for the modifications to take effect.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the local server, ensure that you have Node.js installed correctly and that there are no syntax errors or conflicting processes running on the specified port.

For further assistance, refer to the Node.js documentation or consult relevant online resources.
